        <h1>What are Computing Markets?</h1>
<span class="author">by Ray Grieselhuber</span>
<span class="date">(updated Mar 12, 2010)</span>

<p>I propose a simple definition:</p>

<blockquote>Computing markets are a new type of commodities market similar to energy markets but based on the exchange of computing power.</blockquote>

<p>It is a new growth area for investors and entrepreneurs and represents a dramatic cultural shift as the availability of powerful computational capacity is traded on open markets.</p>

<p>A wider definition, perhaps, should include the actual output of this new era of readily available, cheap computing power: the value-added providers of computing services. These providers make up the market known in various forms as SaaS, cloud applications, cloud computing and web applications.</p>

<p>And in the next year, we shall an increasing number of mobile applications designed specifically to take advantage of the power that cloud-based platforms provide. For indeed, mobile is the perfect demonstration of cloud computing's ability to reduce energy costs on devices with limited energy capacity, such as mobile phones. I will discuss this concept in depth here on Computing Markets.</p>
