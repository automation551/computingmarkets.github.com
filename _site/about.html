        <h1>About ComputingMarkets.com</h1>

<p>Computing Markets is published by me, Ray Grieselhuber.</p>
<p>By day, I run a SaaS company called <a href="http://firewatchingmedia.com">Firewatching Media, K.K.</a>, based in Tokyo, Japan.</p>
<p>Our software application, <a href="http://ginzahq.com" title="Ginza">Ginza</a>, takes advantage of the economic and technical advantages provided by cloud computing technology. During the process of building Ginza, I saw the potential for cloud computing as a cultural and economic catalyst and what might happen if this power were to be commoditized and sold on an open market. Hence, the creation of this site.</p>
<p>As a programmer on cloud-based and mobile systems, I hope to provide a technical slant on the sweeping changes we are likely to see over the next 10-20 years through the increased adoption of cloud-based technology. More importantly, though, the shift to cloud-based computing, driven as it is by technology and the laws of economics, represents nothing less than a evolutionary shift in the way that culture processes and distributes computing power. This is where the real opportunity lies for investors and entrepreneurs where I plan to focus the most.</p>
